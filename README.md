# Tip_Calculator

Playing around with data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, and f-strings.

Calculating percentage, splits, and extras when it comes to tipping at a resturant.

Once again, very simple and experimental.

Learning as I go below:

Data Types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
*String - just characters in quotes that would usually be printed, but can be pulled individually.*

*len with throw up a TypeError if not given a string*

*print('Hello!' [0])*

*Subcripting pulls a particular element from a string and the number between the brackets determines which one its pulling out, starting from 0.*

*print('Hello!' [:])*


To declare an integer, leave the numbers outside the quotes and to replace commas in integers, use underscorces.

*Floating point number*

*Basically just integers with decimals*

Boolean 

Only *True or False* return
Always begin with a capital T and capital F. Used a lot for True/False and for program responsiveness.


*Type*

*Tells you the type of class it is*
*type conversation/casting changes whatever the class of the item at hand into another class*

*char_num = len(input('What is your name? '))*
*new_char_num = str(char_num)*
#*turns it from an integer to a string*

a = 789
print(type(a))
<class int>

str(type(a))
<class str>
